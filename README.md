# Projekt2025-IPP-MIUN
This repository is for a group project in one of my classes that I take. The parts used is arduino uno, ultrasonic sensor (HY-srf05) and a lcd-display. 
Anything uploaded to this github page will be used for our group project.
The project is a 30 seconds timer in a automatic watertap to encourage people to wash their hands for longer. The timer will be counting down from 30 and there will be a report about this project released in the summer.
The using of this code is alright however I probably stole it from someone else...
